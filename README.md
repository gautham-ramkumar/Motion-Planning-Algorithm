# Motion Planning Algorithms: Implementation and Comparison

This README documents a comprehensive implementation and analysis of several sampling-based motion planning algorithms, focusing on their performance across different environmental complexities.

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares four sampling-based motion planning algorithms (RRT, RRT*, BRRT, and BRRT*) in Python. The algorithms are evaluated based on trajectory smoothness, computational efficiency, and path length optimization across varying environmental densities.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree)**: A single-query sampling-based algorithm that builds a space-filling tree to find paths between start and goal configurations
- **RRT* (Optimal RRT)**: An asymptotically optimal extension of RRT that continuously improves path quality
- **BRRT (Bidirectional RRT)**: Grows trees from both start and goal positions simultaneously
- **BRRT* (Bidirectional RRT*)**: Combines bidirectional search with path optimization techniques

## Features

- Python implementation of all four algorithms with customizable parameters
- Visualization tools for trajectory comparison and analysis
- Performance metrics calculation (execution time, path length, smoothness)
- Testing framework for different obstacle density environments
- Detailed comparison reports and visualizations

## Experiment Results

Three distinct 2D environments were used for testing:
- **Light density**: Few obstacles, large open spaces
- **Medium density**: Moderate obstacle coverage
- **Dense environment**: Highly constrained spaces, narrow passages

Key findings:
- RRT* consistently produced shorter paths than RRT at the cost of increased computation time
- BRRT converged faster than standard RRT in all environments
- BRRT* offered the best balance of optimality and efficiency in dense environments
- All algorithms showed degraded performance in the dense environment, with computation time increasing by an average of 58%

## Future Work

- Implementation of RRT, BRRT, and WJRRT algorithms for robotic arm motion planning
- Integration with physical robot simulation environment
- Development of adaptive parameter selection based on environment characteristics
- Parallelization techniques to improve computational efficiency
